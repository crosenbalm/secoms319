Steps to run the site (assuming you have all the software from class downloaded):

1. MongoDB
    a. In mongodb, make sure you have a database named 'coms319' and a collection named 'Items' (preferably not an empty collection)
    b. Connection string should be localhost:27017 (located in the top left corner)

2. Running the local server
    a. Open powershell in the '\secoms319\Assignment_03\assignment03\src' and run 'node server.js'
    b. Successful execution should give a response of "App listening at http://localhost:8081"
    c. IMPORTANT: Keep this powershell window open. This runs the local server that the site runs on.

3. Running the website
    a. Open another powershell window at '\secoms319\Assignment_03\assignment03'
    b. Run 'nodemon App.js'
    c. The site should successfully open and be connected to your local server.
